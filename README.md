The Library Management System In Python is a simple project developed using Python. The project consists of four modules: display book, issue book, add book, Return book. The library management system (LMS) keeps track of the books currently in the library. To develop LMS, we used Python classes, Functions, File Handling, Data and Control Structure, and Looping.
